1. Testing Metadata Extraction...
Extraction Result: {'extraction_raw': 'Since the text does not provide a specific posted date, I will assume it was posted today. However, please note that I\'m an AI and do not have real-time access to the current date. For the purpose of this exercise, I will assume today\'s date is 2024-09-16.\n\nHere is the extracted data in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  "title": "Data Analyst",\n  "company": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)",\n  "location": "Mumbai, India",\n  "posted_date": "2024-09-16",\n  "source": "Company Site"\n}\n```\n\nIf you want me to infer the posted date based on a relative date like \'2 days ago\', please provide the relative date and the current date, and I can calculate the posted date accordingly. \n\nFor example, if the text said \'posted 2 days ago\' and today\'s date is 2024-09-16, I would calculate the posted date as 2024-09-14. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance!'}
