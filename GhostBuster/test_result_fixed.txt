Extraction Result: {'extraction_raw': 'Since the text does not provide a posted date, I will assume it was posted today. However, please note that I\'m an AI and do not have real-time access to the current date. For the purpose of this exercise, I will assume today\'s date is 2024-09-16.\n\nHere is the extracted data in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    "title": "Data Analyst",\n    "company": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)",\n    "location": "Mumbai, India",\n    "posted_date": "2024-09-16",\n    "source": "Company Site"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the `posted_date` field is an assumption, as the text does not provide this information. If you provide the actual current date, I can adjust the `posted_date` field accordingly. \n\nAlso, the `source` field is inferred as "Company Site" based on the URL provided (http://tcs.com/job), which appears to be the company\'s official website.'}
